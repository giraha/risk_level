Project Overview
The Health Risk Level Classification System is designed to determine the risk level of individuals based on various health metrics. By analyzing features such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood sugar levels, age, and more, the system classifies the risk level into three categories: High, Medium, and Low.

Key Features
Health Metric Analysis: Utilizes key health indicators including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and age.
Risk Level Classification: Classifies individuals into three risk levels - High, Medium, and Low - based on their health metrics.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducts a thorough EDA to understand the data distribution, detect outliers, and identify duplicate entries.
Machine Learning Models: Employs various classification models, with a focus on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, Naive Bayes,Logistic Regression.

Technologies and Tools
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning Models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),Naive Bayes,Logistic Regression.

Unique Aspects
Integrated EDA: The inclusion of extensive exploratory data analysis to enhance data quality and model performance.
User-Friendly Classification: Simple three-tier risk classification system for straightforward interpretation.
